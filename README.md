My implementations of various algorithms using no libraries, and whatever language suits my needs.

# Environment Setup

To run the code natively, install NodeJS

To run the code in containers, install Docker

# Run the code (native)

./run_all_tests.sh
```

# Run the code (containers)

```bash
docker build -t algorithms
docker run -it algorithms
```
